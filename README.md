##### 15-112 Term Project Fall 2018

###### [Check out a demo here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9wLGgVlL5U)




Mahjong is a traditional Chinese four player turn based tabletop game that involves swapping tiles to form a winning hand. This implementation provides playability in Tkinter for both multiplayer and against computer AI, as well as an assist mode to help the player. 

It can be simply run through the \_\_init\_\_.py  file and does not require any extra libraries. 

* *"d"* : One can press "d" to view all tiles, including computer tiles, at once in order to see how the computers function. 

* *"q"* : During play, this brings you to the victory screen at the end of the game. 


* "r": Allows you to go back to the start screen in the middle of a game. 

* *"s"* : Toggles the sorting option from the home screen 

* *"h"* : Prints the heuristic score for a hand when a tile is clicked on to show the outcome if it were to be discarded. Backbone of the AI. 

* *"a"* : Shifts between easy and hard AI

Good luck!
